* **Pre-work - SimpleTodo** - allows building a todo list with basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item
* **Project 1 - [Instagram Photo Viewer](https://github.com/kristeaac/codepath-project-1-instagram-photo-viewer)** - read-only media viewer for Instagram which allows a user to check out popular photos and videos 
* **Project 2 - [Google Image Search](https://github.com/kristeaac/codepath-project-2-google-image-search)** - a Google Image Search app which allows a user to select search filters and paginate results infinitely
* **Project 3 - [Simple Tweets](https://github.com/kristeaac/codepath-project-3-twitter-client)** - a simple Twitter client that supports viewing a Twitter timeline and composing a new tweet

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [X] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [X] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [X] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [X] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [X] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [X] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [X] Add button on edit screen to remove a todo item

## Notes

* The styling of the app could be improved. This process was a bit tedious. I would like to learn and apply best practices for designing a good Android app UI.
